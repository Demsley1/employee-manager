# Employee-manager [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
  ## Description 

  This is a project that utilizes node.js, sql, and good old javascript to sort a companies employees into a secure database. From there you can navigate the database in the command line by answering questions through inquirer prompts. The pre-created choices allow any manager to catalog, remove, and view all employees, role, and departments in the company. Making this makes life easier for any boss, while helping me learn all the intricate ways to organize and recall data from the popular SQL database, and this knowledge is guaranteed to stick with me for a long time.
